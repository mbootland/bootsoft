      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        <p>I have lived in Japan for around <%= years_in_japan %> years and I have roughly <%= years_programming %> years of experience as a Software Engineer. 
        The majority of my experience is in Ruby on Rails, is in Ruby on Rails with SQL. However, I have used many languages and frameworks such as
        JavaScript, TypeScript, GoLang, Python and React Native. </p>

        <p>I worked at GMO GlobalSign for approximately 5 years and wrote about 60% of the codebase for the main Rails application. 
        At Rakuten I was primarily responsible for maintaining a questionairre platform which collected 5-8 million 
        questionnaire responses per year. I also developed an API that returned hierarchical staff data to be used for the purpose of 
        cost allocation. </p>

        <p>I left PlayerData at towards the end of October as I was working in the evenings to match UK hours and there are some visa complications involved with
        receiving foreign income.</p>

          PlayerData makes a wearable GPS device that tracks statistics for
          sports professionals to utilize and apply to their training to gain an advantage over their
          competition. PlayerData is one of the fastest growing companies in Europe and has some of the
          best engineers I have ever worked with. I work as a Senior Software Engineer in the Product Engineering Team.
        </p>

        <p>
          I developed both the main API in Ruby on Rails and the mobile application which is React Native
          with TypeScript. The React Native app uses Apollo and GraphQL to query the API. I have
          made over 500 pull requests in the 20 or so months that I was at the company and developed
          many new features. I have also been heavily involved in performance optimisation efforts, maintenance and debugging efforts.

          Rakuten is Japan’s largest e-commerce company and the 3rd largest e-commerce company worldwide. 
          They also sponsor the football team FC Barcelona. I work in the Cloud Marketing Platform Department (MCPD) and largely work on 2 applications; a lottery service and a questionnaire service.

        <p>
          Upon joining Rakuten I completed mandatory training in Linux/Infra and Kubernetes. I completed this faster than any other developer in my department completing all onboarding with 2 months, 
          with the average being 6~9 or so. My main focus has been working on the questionnaire platform which collects 5-8 million questionnaire responses per year.

          GMO GlobalSign is a security company whose main business is selling electronic certificates. My job was to develop TrustLogin, their Single Sign-On (SSO) service. 
          I began as a mid level software engineer with only 1 year experience and quickly rose to being evaluated as the most senior member on the team. 
          At the time of leaving the company roughly 40% of the codebase was written by me.

            Comms365 is an ISP.  They provide fall back internet connections to companies using a device which bonds multiple 3G/4G connections together, 
            essentially creating a high speed portable internet terminal.

          <p>
            I co-developed an Internet Communications Portal which allowed clients to track their own data usage and incoming charges. 
            It was also used to create and assign SIM cards to companies. Data usage was entered into a sharded Mongo database and then map reduced into hourly, daily and monthly data. 
            Naturally the rest of the data was relational and used an SQL database. I also developed a stock system and a log processor service.
